\title{Integrate field notes with water quality monitoring data}
\usage{
add_field_notes(df, notes)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe containing processed time series data for a single
site-parameter combination, typically an element generated by \code{combine_datasets}.}

\item{notes}{A dataframe containing processed field notes from mWater, typically
the output from \code{grab_mWater_sensor_notes()}. These notes include information
about sensor deployment, maintenance, and observed issues.}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing the original time series data enriched with
field note information:
\itemize{
\item All columns from the original time series data
\item sonde_employed: Indicator of sensor deployment status
\item sonde_moved: Indicator of sensor position changes
\item last_site_visit: Timestamp of most recent site visit
\item visit_comments: Technician observations during site visits
\item sensor_malfunction: Noted sensor issues
\item cals_performed: Calibration events
}

Field status information is forward-filled to maintain continuity between
site visits.
}
\description{
This function merges sensor readings with important field
observations about equipment status, maintenance activities, calibration events,
and site conditions.

The function handles the complexity of matching timestamped field notes to the
continuous time series data, ensuring that important information about sensor
deployment, maintenance, and observed issues is properly associated with all
relevant data points. It also performs forward-filling of certain field attributes
to maintain continuity of status information (like deployment status) between
field visits.
