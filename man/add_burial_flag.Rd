\title{Flag all parameters within sonde when sonde burial is detected by DO sensor}
\usage{
add_burial_flag(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe containing all parameters for a single site. Must include columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{parameter}: Measurement type (function looks for "DO" parameter)
\item \code{DT_join}: Character timestamp used for joining measurements across parameters
\item \code{flag}: Existing quality flags, with "Possible burial" flags already applied to DO
measurements by the \code{find_do_noise()} function
}}
}
\value{
A dataframe with the same structure as the input, but with the \code{flag}
column updated to include "Possible burial" flags for all parameters when burial
is detected by the DO sensor.
}
\description{
Identifies and flags all sensor parameters when evidence of sonde burial is detected
by the dissolved oxygen (DO) sensor. When a monitoring sonde becomes buried in sediment,
all measurements are affected, but the DO sensor often provides the clearest indication
of burial events.

This function propagates burial flags detected by the \code{find_do_noise()} function to all
other parameters measured at the same time points. This ensures consistent flagging
across all measurements during burial events.

Unlike most flagging functions, this function operates on site-level dataframes
containing multiple parameters rather than individual site-parameter combinations.
