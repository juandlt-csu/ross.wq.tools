\title{Flag measurements taken during freezing conditions}
\usage{
add_frozen_flag(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing all parameters for a single site. Must include columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{DT_round}: Timestamp for each measurement
\item \code{DT_join}: Character timestamp used for joining
\item \code{parameter}: Measurement type (function looks for "Temperature")
\item \code{mean}: The calculated mean value of measurements
\item \code{flag}: Existing quality flags (will be updated by this function)
}}
}
\value{
A data frame with the same structure as the input, but with the \code{flag}
column updated to include "frozen" for all parameters when water temperature
is at or below 0°C.
}
\description{
Identifies and flags water quality measurements collected when water temperature
was at or below freezing (0°C). This function helps identify periods when ice formation
may affect sensor readings across all parameters at a site.

Unlike most flagging functions that operate on individual parameters, this function
requires a site-level dataframe containing temperature data and applies freezing
flags across all parameters.
