\usage{
add_spec_flag(
  df,
  spec_table = yaml::read_yaml("data/qaqc/sensor_spec_thresholds.yml")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing water quality measurements. Must include columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{parameter}: The measurement type (e.g., "Temperature", "DO", "Actual Conductivity")
\item \code{mean}: The calculated mean value of measurements
\item \code{flag}: Existing quality flags (will be updated by this function)
}}

\item{spec_table}{The path to a YAML file containing sensor specification thresholds,
or a pre-loaded list of thresholds. Default is \code{"data/qaqc/sensor_spec_thresholds.yml"}.
The file should be structured with parameter names as top-level keys, each containing
'min' and 'max' subkeys defining the acceptable range.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the same structure as the input, but with the flag
column updated to include "outside of sensor specification range" for any
measurements that exceed manufacturer specifications.
}
\description{
Identifies and flags water quality measurements that fall outside the manufacturer's
specified operating ranges for each sensor type. These flags help distinguish between
extreme but valid environmental conditions and readings that exceed the sensor's
technical capabilities, which may be less reliable.

The function references predefined minimum and maximum threshold values stored in
a configuration file (by default in \code{'data/qaqc/sensor_spec_thresholds.yml'}). When
measurements in the \code{mean} column fall below the minimum or above the maximum
specification for that particular parameter, the function adds an appropriate quality flag.
