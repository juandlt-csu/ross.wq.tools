\title{Fix and standardize site names in a dataframe}
\usage{
fix_site_names(df, site_col = "site")
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe containing a column with site names to be standardized}

\item{site_col}{The name of the column containing site names (default: "site")}
}
\value{
A dataframe with the same structure as the input, but with standardized site names
}
\description{
This function standardizes site names by converting them to lowercase and
replacing specific site names with their standardized equivalents. It handles
case-insensitive matching and performs the following replacements:
\itemize{
\item "tamasag" -> "bellvue"
\item "legacy" -> "salyer"
\item "lincoln" -> "udall"
\item "timberline" -> "riverbend"
\item "prospect" -> "cottonwood"
\item "boxelder" -> "elc"
\item "archery" -> "archery" (no change)
\item "river bluffs" -> "riverbluffs" (removes space)
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Example usage with default column name
sample_df <- data.frame(site = c("Tamasag", "LEGACY", "River Bluffs"))
fixed_df <- fix_site_names(sample_df)

# Example usage with custom column name
sample_df2 <- data.frame(location = c("Tamasag", "LEGACY", "River Bluffs"))
fixed_df2 <- fix_site_names(sample_df2, site_col = "location")
}
