\title{Merge historical and new water quality monitoring data}
\usage{
combine_datasets(incoming_data_list, historical_data_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{incoming_data_list}{A list of dataframes containing newly collected water
quality data, typically the output from tidy_api_data(). Each list element
should be named with the "site-parameter" naming convention.}

\item{historical_data_list}{A list of dataframes containing previously processed
and flagged historical data. Each list element should follow the same
"site-parameter" naming convention as the incoming_data_list.}
}
\value{
A list of dataframes containing merged historical and incoming data.
Each dataframe includes:
\itemize{
\item All columns from the original dataframes
\item A "historical" boolean column indicating data source (TRUE for historical data)
\item Quality flags preserved from historical data
The result contains only site-parameter combinations present in both input lists,
unless one list is empty, in which case all elements from the non-empty list
are returned.
}
}
\description{
Combines newly collected water quality data with recent historical data to
create continuous time series for each site-parameter combination. This function
is critical for maintaining data continuity across data collection cycles.

The function preserves quality flags from historical data, adds a marker to
distinguish historical from new observations, and handles several special cases
including missing data scenarios. By integrating the most recent 24 hours of
historical data with new readings, it creates an overlap period that helps
identify sensor drift and ensures smooth transitions between data collection cycles.
