\title{Flag suspect data based on context patterns}
\usage{
add_suspect_flag(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe containing water quality measurements. Must include columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{mean}: The measurement value (NA indicates missing data)
\item \code{auto_flag}: Existing quality flags
}}
}
\value{
A dataframe with the same structure as the input, but with the \code{auto_flag}
column updated to include "suspect data" flags for measurements that match the
specified conditions.
}
\description{
Identifies and flags potentially problematic measurements that appear valid in isolation
but are suspect due to surrounding data patterns. The function applies the "suspect data"
flag in two scenarios:
\enumerate{
\item When an unflagged measurement falls within a 2-hour window where ≥50\% of surrounding
data points have quality flags
\item When an isolated measurement appears within a 2-hour window where ≥90\% of surrounding
data is missing
}
