\title{Calculate contextual statistics for water quality time series}
\usage{
generate_summary_statistics(site_param_df)
}
\arguments{
\item{site_param_df}{A dataframe containing time series data for a single
site-parameter combination. Must include:
\itemize{
\item DT_round: Timestamp for each observation
\item mean: The measured parameter value
}}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing all original columns plus the following added
statistical context columns:
\itemize{
\item front1/back1: Values immediately ahead of and behind each point
\item rollmed/rollavg/rollsd: 7-point rolling median, mean, and standard deviation
\item slope_ahead/slope_behind: Rate of change to adjacent points
\item rollslope: 7-point rolling slope average
\item month/year/y_m: Temporal classification components
\item season: Hydrological season classification (winter_baseflow, snowmelt,
monsoon, fall_baseflow)
}
}
\description{
Enhances water quality time series data with a comprehensive set of statistical
context metrics that support anomaly detection and pattern analysis. This function
calculates both temporal relationships (how each reading relates to adjacent points)
and rolling statistics (how each reading fits within recent trends).

The function generates several types of contextual information:
\itemize{
\item Adjacent value comparison: Values immediately before and after each point
\item Rolling statistics: 7-point rolling median, mean, and standard deviation
\item Rate-of-change metrics: Slope calculations for trend analysis
\item Temporal context: Month, year, and seasonal classification
}

These statistics provide the foundation for subsequent quality control processes
by establishing the expected behavior patterns and natural variability of each
parameter at each site. The 7-point window (covering ~90 minutes for 15-minute
data) captures short-term patterns while accommodating brief anomalies.
