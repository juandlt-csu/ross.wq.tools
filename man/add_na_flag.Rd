\title{Flag missing data in water quality measurements}
\usage{
add_na_flag(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing water quality measurements. Must include columns:
\itemize{
\item mean: The calculated mean value of measurements (function checks this for NA values)
\item flag: Existing quality flags (will be updated by this function)
}}
}
\value{
A data frame with the same structure as the input, but with the flag
column updated to include "missing data" for any rows where the mean value is NA.
}
\description{
Identifies and flags rows in water quality data where measurements are missing (NA values).
This function helps maintain data quality by explicitly marking gaps in the continuous
monitoring record, allowing downstream analysis to properly handle these missing values.
