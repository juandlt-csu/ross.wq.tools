#' @description
#' Identifies and flags water quality measurements that fall outside expected seasonal 
#' patterns based on historical data. This function applies two distinct quality flags:
#'
#' 1. "outside of seasonal range" - Applied when a measurement falls outside the 1st-99th
#' percentile range of historical measurements for that site, parameter, and season
#'
#' 2. "slope violation" - Applied when the rate of change (slope) between consecutive
#' measurements exceeds historical thresholds, potentially indicating sensor malfunction
#' or unusual environmental events
#'
#' These flags help distinguish between natural seasonal variation and potentially
#' problematic measurements requiring further investigation.
#'
#' @param df A data frame containing water quality measurements. Must include columns:
#' - `site`: Standardized site name
#' - `parameter`: The measurement type
#' - `mean`: The calculated mean value of measurements
#' - `season`: Season categorization for the measurement
#' - `slope_ahead`: Rate of change to the next measurement
#' - `slope_behind`: Rate of change from the previous measurement
#' - `flag`: Existing quality flags (will be updated by this function)
#'
#' @param threshold_table A dataframe containing seasonal threshold values with columns:
#' - `site`: Site name matching the df site column
#' - `parameter`: Parameter name matching the df parameter column
#' - `season`: Season categorization (e.g., "spring", "summer")
#' - `t_mean01`: 1st percentile threshold for the mean value
#' - `t_mean99`: 99th percentile threshold for the mean value
#' - `t_slope_behind_01`: 1st percentile threshold for slope values
#' - `t_slope_behind_99`: 99th percentile threshold for slope values
#'
#' @return A data frame with the same structure as the input, but with the flag
#' column updated to include "outside of seasonal range" and/or "slope violation"
#' flags as appropriate.
