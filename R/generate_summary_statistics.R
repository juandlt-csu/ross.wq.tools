#' @title Calculate contextual statistics for water quality time series
#' @export
#'
#' @description
#' Enhances water quality time series data with a comprehensive set of statistical
#' context metrics that support anomaly detection and pattern analysis. This function
#' calculates both temporal relationships (how each reading relates to adjacent points)
#' and rolling statistics (how each reading fits within recent trends).
#'
#' The function generates several types of contextual information:
#' - Adjacent value comparison: Values immediately before and after each point
#' - Rolling statistics: 7-point rolling median, mean, and standard deviation
#' - Rate-of-change metrics: Slope calculations for trend analysis
#' - Temporal context: Month, year, and seasonal classification
#'
#' These statistics provide the foundation for subsequent quality control processes
#' by establishing the expected behavior patterns and natural variability of each
#' parameter at each site. The 7-point window (covering ~90 minutes for 15-minute
#' data) captures short-term patterns while accommodating brief anomalies.
#'
#' @param site_param_df A dataframe containing time series data for a single
#' site-parameter combination. Must include:
#' - DT_round: Timestamp for each observation
#' - mean: The measured parameter value
#'
#' @return A dataframe containing all original columns plus the following added
#' statistical context columns:
#' - front1/back1: Values immediately ahead of and behind each point
#' - rollmed/rollavg/rollsd: 7-point rolling median, mean, and standard deviation
#' - slope_ahead/slope_behind: Rate of change to adjacent points
#' - rollslope: 7-point rolling slope average
#' - month/year/y_m: Temporal classification components
#' - season: Hydrological season classification (winter_baseflow, snowmelt,
#'   monsoon, fall_baseflow)
