#' @title Extract sensor maintenance field notes from mWater data
#' @export
#'
#' @description
#' Processes mWater field data to extract and format records specifically related to 
#' sensor maintenance, calibration, and deployment activities. This function filters 
#' for relevant visit types, formats equipment change information, and standardizes 
#' the data structure to match downstream QAQC processing requirements.
#'
#' This function focuses on routine sensor operations (cleaning, calibration, deployment)
#' and explicitly excludes sensor malfunction records, which are handled separately by
#' `grab_mWater_malfunction_notes()`.
#'
#' @param mWater_api_data A dataframe containing field notes from mWater, typically
#' the output from `load_mWater()`.
#'
#' @return A dataframe containing only sensor maintenance records with standardized columns:
#' - site: Location identifier
#' - DT_round/DT_join: Timestamps for joining with sensor data
#' - sonde_employed: Binary indicator of deployment status
#' - sensor_swapped_notes: Formatted notes about equipment changes
#' - Various maintenance fields (sensors_cleaned, cals_performed, etc.)
