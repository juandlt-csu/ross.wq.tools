#' @title Load and tidy old field notes
#' @export
#'
#' @description A function that uploads and cleans the field notes excel file. This function adds datetime
#' columns to the field notes dataframe and filters out field notes where the sensor
#' was not handled.
#' @param filepath A file path to the raw field notes.
#' @param summarize_interval At what time interval the user would like the data set to be aggregated and rounded to. Default is 15 minutes.
#' @return A dataframe with the field notes.
