#' @title Flag periods when sonde depth was changed

#' @description
#' Identifies and flags time periods when sondes were physically 
#' moved or repositioned in their housings. Sonde depth changes can affect multiple 
#' parameters and cause discontinuities in the data that aren't related to actual 
#' environmental changes.
#'
#' The function handles two different data processing workflows:
#' - Pre-2024 data: Uses a separate table that tracks when sondes were moved
#' - Post-2024 data: Uses information already integrated into field notes 
#'   through the `sonde_moved` boolean field
#'
#' @param df A data frame containing water quality measurements. Must include columns:
#' - `site`: Standardized site name
#' - `DT_join`: Character timestamp in a format compatible with joining to field notes
#' - `flag`: Existing quality flags (will be updated by this function)
#' - `sonde_moved`: Boolean field indicating if sonde was moved (only required when `post2024 = TRUE`)
#'
#' @param level_shift_table A data frame containing field notes with information about 
#' when sondes were physically moved. When `post2024 = FALSE`, must include columns:
#' - `site`: Site name matching the df site column
#' - `DT_join`: Timestamp of the sonde movement
#' - `type`: Field identifying records where type = "sonde moved"
#'
#' @param post2024 Logical value indicating whether the data is from before (FALSE) or 
#' after (TRUE) the 2024 field season. Default is TRUE.
#'
#' @return A data frame with the same structure as the input, plus an additional
#' `depth_change` column containing "sonde moved" flags where applicable.
